## Background Description
Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. This data will be used to

You will be using this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, you will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Data Source
The data is located in the Resources folder.

- lending_data.csv

Import the data using Pandas.

## Application Used
- Python (Pandas)

## Consider the Models
You will be creating and comparing two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. Before you create, fit, and score the models, make a prediction as to which model you think will perform better. You do not need to be correct! Write down (in markdown cells in your Jupyter Notebook or in a separate document) your prediction, and provide justification for your educated guess.

- My prediction: Logistic Regression model will perform better. 

## Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model
Create a LogisticRegression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score. Do the same for a RandomForestClassifier. You may choose any starting hyperparameters you like. Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction? Write down your results and thoughts.

## Summary
#### My prediction did come right as Logistic Regression Model Model was 0.9924 compared Forest Classifier Model at 0.9922
